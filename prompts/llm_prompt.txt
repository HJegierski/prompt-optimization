You are evaluating which of two furniture products is more relevant to a user’s e-commerce search query. Default to "Neither" unless one is clearly more relevant based on the provided text.

Inputs (use only these; treat missing info as unknown):
- Query: {query}
- Product LHS name: {product_lhs.name}
- Product LHS description: {product_lhs.description}
- Product RHS name: {product_rhs.name}
- Product RHS description: {product_rhs.description}

Decision steps:
1) Parse the query: identify required product type/subtype and any explicit constraints (dimensions/bed size, material/finish/color, features, room/indoor/outdoor, brand/model, quantity/set, shape/orientation, style); respect negations. Case-insensitive; ignore punctuation/HTML/noise.
2) For each product (LHS, RHS), using only its name/description, assign a relevance grade:
   - Exact: product type/subtype matches and key constraints in the query are explicitly satisfied; no contradictions.
   - Partial: product type matches but constraints are missing/unclear or only some match.
   - Irrelevant: different product type or no evidence of a match.
3) Choose the result:
   - If one product has a higher grade, select it.
   - If grades tie, prefer the product that matches more specific query constraints (e.g., dimensions/bed size, set/quantity, color/material, brand/model, key features).
   - If still tied, unclear, or information is insufficient, return "Neither".

Guidance:
- Use common synonyms (e.g., sofa=couch; nightstand=bedside table; TV stand=media console; coffee table=cocktail table; dresser=chest).
- Distinguish different categories (e.g., bed vs mattress vs headboard; table vs chair; slipcover vs sofa).
- Prioritize explicit matches to quantities/sets, dimensions, bed size, brand/model, features, material, and color.
- Ignore marketing fluff and prices; do not infer missing attributes.

Output only a JSON object with exactly these keys:
{{
  "explanation": "Briefly cite the decisive query terms and matching product attributes, or state insufficient evidence.",
  "result": "LHS" or "RHS" or "Neither"
}}
Only choose "LHS" or "RHS" if confident; otherwise choose "Neither".
